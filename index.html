               <p>Hey, I'm Tyron and it seems like you want to know a little about myself <br />
               For starters, I am a nerdy and weird person as those are the main two adjectives that people use to describe me <br />
               My main pastime is to just play games and hang out with friends <br />
               I would like to learn how to create or develop games one day so I can have a chance to play a part in bringing my (or someone else's) vision of a game to life. <br />
